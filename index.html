            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce
                yourself
                because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see
                what
                kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and
                your
                impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.I am a person who is positive about every aspect
                of
                life.</p>
