            <h3>About me..... </h3>
            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce
                yourself
                because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see
                what
                kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and
                your
                impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.I am a person who is positive about every aspect
                of
                life.</p>

            <h3> To Become a......</h3>
            <p>There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to
                think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I
                like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the
                wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do
                thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in
                summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be
                alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise;</p>
